# DVRescue

Archivist-made software that supports data migration from DV tapes into digital files suitable for long-term preservation.

DVRescue was presented at the Association of Moving Image Archivists 2019 conference. Slides from the presentation are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JFYHaKMZWHd8LFOVWmGuxdLNgFOiSXcoSxCMB-TXCvA/edit?usp=sharing).

A status update of DVRescue was presented at the Association of Moving Image Archivists 2020 conference. The presentation video can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/YGPIqJ4_ssI).

### Additional tools

Within this repository are additional tools used to supplement DVRescue. For demonstrations on how to use the command line tools, please see the AMIA 2020 presentation video [here](https://youtu.be/YGPIqJ4_ssI) and related blog posts [here](https://mipops.tumblr.com/).

They are:

**dvloupe** A script that reports on a single frame with color coding and related data.

**dvmap** A script that makes the arrays used in dvloupe. (Not very useful on its own)

**dvpackager** A script that rewraps one DV stream into two MOV files. Used for splitting DV files when the significant characteristics change.

**dvplay** A script that plays back and visualizes the DV errors as a stack of images. Running with the `-x` flag will produce JPEGs instead of just playing them. Requires FFplay. 

**dvrescue.xsd** This file can be used to validate a DVRescue XML output. It also contains definitions of the DVRescue parameters.

**dvsampler** A script that downloads or creates DV files to use as samples. Requires FFmpeg.

**dvmerge** A script that takes multiple transfers of the same tape containing errors and combines them to create one file with the best information available for each problematic frame. 

**dvguidance** A collection of additional resources including documentation, video demostrations, and solutions for how the operator may improve the transfer as guided by DVRescue.
